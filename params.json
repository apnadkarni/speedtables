Hopefully at some point changes can\r\nbe merged back upstream. See the README.win32 file for Windows specific\r\ndetails. Note the Windows port is on the `windows` branch.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFrom the original [original Speedtables](https://github.com/flightaware/speedtables) project:\r\n\r\nSpeed tables is a high-performance memory-resident database. The speed\r\ntable compiler reads a table definition and generates a set of C\r\naccess routines to create, manipulate and search tables containing\r\nmillions of rows. Currently oriented towards Tcl.  Licensed under BSD Copyright.\r\n\r\nFor more details about Speed tables, see ctables/docs/doc.txt\r\n\r\nThis repository consists of three separate Tcl packages:\r\n\r\n* ctables -- the primary package providing single-process and shared-memory tables.\r\n* ctable_server -- networked client and server interface using \"sttp:\" URI syntax.\r\n* stapi -- abstraction to allow ctables, ctable_server, and other interchangable object use.\r\n"}
