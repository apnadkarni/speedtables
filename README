This is a fork of Flightaware's speedtables library solely for the
purpose of porting to Windows. Hopefully at some point changes can
be merged back upstream. See the README.win32 file for Windows specific
details.

Speed tables is a high-performance memory-resident database. The speed
table compiler reads a table definition and generates a set of C
access routines to create, manipulate and search tables containing
millions of rows. Currently oriented towards Tcl.  Licensed under BSD Copyright.

This repository consists of three separate Tcl packages:

* ctables -- the primary package providing single-process and shared-memory tables.
* ctable_server -- networked client and server interface using "sttp:" URI syntax.
* stapi -- abstraction to allow ctables, ctable_server, and other interchangable object use.
